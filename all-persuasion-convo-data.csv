Jp2xrD,Jp2xrDbuJZXwFLMmwJpZVEtQ0kt1,can't complain. how are you?,2022-02-11T18:37:53.654Z,Opening remarks user response,Persuadee,1
JPAG9k,JPAG9kET5Oh5kNtNjXYPJrmj3ys1,Not bad either! Have you heard of online learning before?,2022-02-11T18:38:01.824Z,Experience-related inquiry,Persuader,1
Jp2xrD,Jp2xrDbuJZXwFLMmwJpZVEtQ0kt1,yes and I've gone through it both in high school and college,2022-02-11T18:38:17.966Z,Experience-related user response,Persuadee,1
JPAG9k,JPAG9kET5Oh5kNtNjXYPJrmj3ys1,Interesting! It sounds like a pretty good idea considering now you have a lot of old lectures and content to look through,2022-02-11T18:39:02.761Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,1
Jp2xrD,Jp2xrDbuJZXwFLMmwJpZVEtQ0kt1,"it is a helpful study tool, but I tend to not focus on the lectures if I'm just watching a video. I get distracted by outside factors that I wouldn't have in the classroom setting.",2022-02-11T18:40:04.151Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,1
JPAG9k,JPAG9kET5Oh5kNtNjXYPJrmj3ys1,"I see, I believe that online lectures can be helpful when you have missed a day of school and need to make things up",2022-02-11T18:41:21.196Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,1
Jp2xrD,Jp2xrDbuJZXwFLMmwJpZVEtQ0kt1,"True,but I think having a relationship with your professor is important in learning and with online learning it takes away from that relationship. Also, the motivation to make up the lectures is so low if there is no penalty for being behind/missing things",2022-02-11T18:43:05.102Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,1
JPAG9k,JPAG9kET5Oh5kNtNjXYPJrmj3ys1,"That sounds logical indeed, it's hard to be motivated when there's no people around you. New point: Would you agree that kids who have physical disabilities would have a better time learning without having to deal with the physical impediments of in-person learning?",2022-02-11T18:43:48.073Z,Thought-provoking inquiry,Persuader,1
Jp2xrD,Jp2xrDbuJZXwFLMmwJpZVEtQ0kt1,I think that it would help them somewhat but once done with schooling there could be limited options of work that is online depending on career path. If they get practice with the difficulties of every day things in school then it would better prepare them once they leave.,2022-02-11T18:45:16.326Z,Thought-provoking user response,Persuadee,1
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,"Hi, how are you? I am pretty sure you are aware of online learning. I believe it has had numerous advantages in the past few months by giving access to multitude of students across different cultures and countries.",2022-03-31T21:04:04.047Z,Opening remarks,Persuader,2
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,Hi! I definitely have heard of some people who benefitted a lot from the online platform.,2022-03-31T21:05:41.088Z,Opening remarks user response,Persuadee,2
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"But personally I haven't had the best experience from online learning. I 100% prefer having classes online, even though that means I have to wake up and get dressed for them.",2022-03-31T21:05:41.088Z,Personal story user response,Persuadee,2
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,But haven't you ever had a time where you had to miss class for a medical emergency or any other family emergencies that required you to make up the material in order to complete assignments? Online learning eliminates any obstacles that come with uncertainties that arise.,2022-03-31T21:07:42.483Z,Personal-related inquiry,Persuader,2
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,I had a medical instance while my school was fully online and the fact that my classes were online did not change my learning experience. I still had to miss things because I was too physcially unwell to complete/attend them. So not all of the obstacles are ctually eliminated.,2022-03-31T21:09:42.373Z,Personal story user response,Persuadee,2
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,"I would say that is primarily dependent on the professor and whether he would accept the assignment. Nonetheless, that doesn't refute the point that you could access the material at any point of time for learning or review.  ",2022-03-31T21:12:27.997Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,2
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,I can speak from personal experience when I had to leave school for sometime and yet I was still able to expand my learning through various professional certification programs,2022-03-31T21:12:27.997Z,Personal story,Persuader,2
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"That for sure is a great experience for you! I just think that overall, learning is better in-person. I missed out on actual lab experience when everything was online and so trying to apply that ""knowledge"" in my classes and work now is very frustrating because I couldn't really learn it. There are also many people I know who appeared to have ""learned"" more based on their grades, but that is due to the probability and ease of prohibited assitance being available. It just doesn't help in the long run.",2022-03-31T21:15:27.558Z,Personal story user response,Persuadee,2
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,You know you make a good point! Have you thought about other countries that would still love to have access to quality education but don't have enough money to relocate to the U.S.? ,2022-03-31T21:22:26.490Z,Emotional appeal,Persuader,2
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,"In this age of technology, those students are able to get access to educational content for a cheaper if not free payment. Even though most people appear to have ""learned"" on the basis of their grades, I believe that is because people weren't used to this format of learning yet. There are a couple of studies done on middle school students that have showed better comprehension in their learnings due to the various forms of game related content that online learning provided.",2022-03-31T21:22:26.490Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,2
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"I agree that providing this learning to people overseas could be better than no learning at all. But if the argument is in person versus online, I still stand by believing in-person provides a richer experience for the student. And as for the middle school relation for classes and games, I would say that if the learning is in game form, it may show an increase in correct answers but may not be sored in the long-term memory sector of the brain since it's presented as quick info. But anyway, it was great chatting with you. I hope to continue this conversation or another one later on with you!",2022-03-31T21:27:47.925Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,2
NZK0tW,NZK0tWmwVLO4dzsR12XBBQKkWCm1,"I enjoyed this debate, let's agree to disagree. It was great talking with you though!",2022-03-31T21:29:14.270Z,Closing remarks,Persuader,2
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"Hello, I hope your day is going well!",2022-03-31T21:44:27.937Z,Opening remarks,Persuader,3
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2, I was wondering how you feel about online learning for students? ,2022-03-31T21:44:27.937Z,Thought-provoking inquiry,Persuader,3
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"Personally, I've found online learning to be quite beneficial in my educational experience. For starters, it is so much easier for me and my classmates to access our course information on the online platform. Whether we are looking back on assignments or instructions or notes, everything was found much more smoothly for my classes that were all online. My professors had all of their teachings right there at their fingertips to hand out to us whenever we asked for it to help us study.",2022-03-31T21:44:27.937Z,Personal story,Persuader,3
73D9Y9,73D9Y9whhPW9swSHCQcFMguU5av2,"Hello! I personally think that learning online is detrimental to the learning of those who are taking classes online. A lot of the teachers that do the online format have a difficult time using the online format. Also, looking back at assignments and other resources can be done without the online format because most schools use a website to keep their class materials on.",2022-03-31T21:49:42.947Z,Thought-provoking inquiry user response,Persuadee,3
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"I understand the concern for teachers not understanding the online format, but did you ever think about there being some crash courses for those who need to learn how to be the hosts of the format? ",2022-03-31T21:58:59.470Z,Scenario-based inquiry,Persuader,3
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"I think that could alleviate that concern. That is also true about looking back at some assignments/content, but there were many classes that have recorded lectures. When the class is online, there is a record of the class as the teachers can record the questions and answers going on in live time and that is what can be saved in an online format. I feel like if the class is in person, that is always an option, but it is a bit more difficult to make sure the teacher sets up the camera in the right position and that the microphone is set up and working. There are more variables for the in person format.",2022-03-31T21:58:59.470Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,3
73D9Y9,73D9Y9whhPW9swSHCQcFMguU5av2,I feel that there are less factors for the in person format because if the student is in person the efficiency of learning is much higher because of the way that the questions being asked can be asked much faster than online and the ease of asking the question is much higher (the camera and microphone working for every student is an issue and slows down the speed at which the teacher can teach the class).,2022-03-31T22:02:37.661Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,3
73D9Y9,73D9Y9whhPW9swSHCQcFMguU5av2,"Regarding the crash course, even after crash courses there are always bugs in the way that people use online things; internet, glitches, cameras working, microphones working, etc.",2022-03-31T22:02:37.661Z,Scenario-based inquiry user response,Persuadee,3
5NiuUN,5NiuUNkeudeJPTuqyym7FhVB2Hk2,"There are less factors for in person, if the student is able to make it, but life happens and there could always be a reason that one may need to miss a class. But I do understand the unreliability of internet connection. Anyway, this was a great discussion, but I've got to go. Talk to you later!",2022-03-31T22:05:24.038Z,Closing remarks,Persuader,3
73D9Y9,73D9Y9whhPW9swSHCQcFMguU5av2,I agree! That was a wonderful conversation! Have a great one.,2022-03-31T22:06:04.652Z,User agreement,Persuadee,3

ifdpvx,ifdpvxIKDLM7pYxEViwWc3yMOWt2,Do you have a opinion about online learning?,2022-04-01T02:16:29.458Z,Thought-provoking inquiry user response,Persuadee,4
oPWbAm,oPWbAmlYEgc12SdpZC4RDLF8vdg2,"Yes, I believe that it is a good thing because it allows more people the flexibility to acsess a quality education that they might not otherwise have",2022-04-01T02:17:10.783Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,4
ifdpvx,ifdpvxIKDLM7pYxEViwWc3yMOWt2,"That's true, but don't you feel like it's helpful to have hands-on learning, like in-person with a professor or teacher?",2022-04-01T02:17:55.503Z,Thought-provoking inquiry user response,Persuadee,4
oPWbAm,oPWbAmlYEgc12SdpZC4RDLF8vdg2,I do but I also believe that that can be mimicked by having synchronous lecture of do it yourself labs and activitites. In a way it is kind of more of a you get out what you put in so those who are motivated can make it work,2022-04-01T02:18:55.661Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,4
ifdpvx,ifdpvxIKDLM7pYxEViwWc3yMOWt2,I guess that's true... Do you think there is a way to help hold students accountable online? ,2022-04-01T02:20:14.691Z,Thought-provoking inquiry user response,Persuadee,4
ifdpvx,ifdpvxIKDLM7pYxEViwWc3yMOWt2," In my experience, a lot of students will slack off and not do their work",2022-04-01T02:20:14.691Z,Personal story user response,Persuadee,4
oPWbAm,oPWbAmlYEgc12SdpZC4RDLF8vdg2,"That is definitely harder online, I think that as much as I dont enjoy it requiring cameras on during lectures is helpful for that. I also believe it works better with older age groups who are more self motivated and actively choosing to put themselves in a learning enviroment",2022-04-01T02:22:05.804Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,4
ifdpvx,ifdpvxIKDLM7pYxEViwWc3yMOWt2,That is a good point!  I guess it also allows more flexibility for those older students as well...,2022-04-01T02:23:38.088Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,4
oPWbAm,oPWbAmlYEgc12SdpZC4RDLF8vdg2,I think it is definitely something that is extremely useful but not applicable to every scenario,2022-04-01T02:24:10.566Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,4
ifdpvx,ifdpvxIKDLM7pYxEViwWc3yMOWt2,Okay!  I am glad you have convinced me!,2022-04-01T02:24:42.149Z,User agreement,Persuadee,4

47qUDi,47qUDinKzxQYE6EErSYsK1ctw0w2,I have some reservations about it. What's your opinion?,2022-04-01T20:04:38.561Z,Thought-provoking inquiry user response,Persuadee,5
fQaALq,fQaALqLuxWXGPQHrtBk7bkbzauY2,"I think it's a miracle! The fact that you can be anywhere in the world to learn something new on your personal device, I think it's rather revolutionary!",2022-04-01T20:05:35.698Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,5
47qUDi,47qUDinKzxQYE6EErSYsK1ctw0w2,"Fair, but there is the issue that if you are ""anywhere in the world"", you may be in a different time zone from the rest of the class, and that could be inconvenient to some students.",2022-04-01T20:06:18.375Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,5
fQaALq,fQaALqLuxWXGPQHrtBk7bkbzauY2,That is where the asynchronous aspect comes into play. Lectures can be pre recorded and students could watch them anytime. In this way your time zone doesn't matter.,2022-04-01T20:07:21.232Z,Logical appeal,Persuader,5
47qUDi,47qUDinKzxQYE6EErSYsK1ctw0w2,"There are some benefits to asynchronous learning. However, some students may require structure, which having class at a specific time provides.

fQaALq,fQaALqLuxWXGPQHrtBk7bkbzauY2,"That brings in the flexibility aspect. Students can tackle these topics whenever they want. And when it comes to how regular they are, that is their problem.

47qUDi,47qUDinKzxQYE6EErSYsK1ctw0w2,"I believe that everyone being in the classroom makes it easier to have discipline and work to the greater goal of pursuing education. All of the students are in the same room and can hear the professor in real-time, not having to worry about a lag. It also makes it easier to work in groups when people can be right by each other and collaborate while being able to see the same material.",2022-04-01T20:12:29.846Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,5
fQaALq,fQaALqLuxWXGPQHrtBk7bkbzauY2,"What about the times when it is physically impossible to be in a classroom?

Zer2tH,Zer2tHPMO8YJYqDXeJT3sJiOmaG2,"If necessary, during in-person office hours, with the professor's consent you can still record them to rewatch/relisten at a later date. You can also voice your confusion as a student to the professor even after the second explanation and that will allow you to work together to go step by step through the problem in order to get to the root of the problem. However, I acknowledge that technically online learning and in-person learning have the common factor of office hours in certain situations which will benefit the student either ways. The biggest differentiator is the lectures. Being online, you can not immediately stop your professor and get your confusion cleared up right away. If you have a question it requires you still finishing the video, which risk further unnecessary confusion, and emailing/messaging the professor after. This takes up unnecessary time that could potentially be solved by a quick raise of the hand.",2022-03-09T02:31:15.070Z,Logical appeal user response,Persuadee,17
IiHPIa,IiHPIaUjFDRcqYrnPoAnK1BXBFj2,"I think that's a fair concern if we're only talking about instruction given through recorded videos, but a lot of lectures are synchronous, thus you can always interrupt the professor.
